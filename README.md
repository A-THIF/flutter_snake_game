# 🐍 Snake Game – Built with Flutter

A modern, offline remake of the classic **Snake Game**, handcrafted in **Flutter**.  
This project explores how far you can go using **just gestures**, **custom drawing**, and **game logic** without any external engines like Flame.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Recreate the **core Snake mechanics** in Flutter from scratch — no multiplayer, no ads, no internet — just simple, smooth, offline fun with intuitive controls.

---

## 🚀 Current Features

- ✅ **Dynamic glowing snake body** (grows with food)
- ✅ **Apple food** (glows + relocates when eaten)
- ✅ **Edge wrap-around** (snake reappears from the other side)
- ✅ **Self-collision detection** (game over)
- ✅ **Score counter**
- ✅ **Restart dialog**
- ✅ **Improved gesture controls** — tap left/right sides to turn
- ✅ **Visible mid-screen arrows** for clear control cues

---

## 🆕 What’s New in v1.1

- ✅ Added **dedicated vertical left/right control strips**
- ✅ Visible arrow icons centered for clearer tap targets

- ✅ Settled on **tap gestures** for simple, classic control
- ✅ Built from scratch: no game engines, just Flutter widgets & canvas

### ⚙️ Bugs & Fixes:
- 🐛 Snake moving in partial screen only — fixed with layout callbacks
- 🐛 Wrap-around glitches fixed with better coordinate math
- 🐛 Gradle & APK signing issues solved for smooth publishing

## 🗺️ What’s Next?

**Planned Experiments:**

- 🎮 D-Pad or on-screen joystick
- 🎮 Continuous turn with long press

**Visuals:**
- ✨ Animate apple when eaten
- ✨ Better snake body shading
